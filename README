Dependencies
------------
 * eulcore (currently included as a subversion external)
 * eXist-db 1.4 
 * xhtml2pdf/Pisa for PDF generation (http://www.xhtml2pdf.com)


Installation
------------
Install and configure like other django applications.

Copy ``localsettings-sample.py`` to ``localsettings.py`` and configure. 

The configured eXist-db user should be in the DBA group if you plan to
use the app to manage the eXist index configuration. For more
information on existdb index commands::

     $ ./manage.py help existdb_index
     $ ./manage.py help existdb_reindex

For a first-time install, you will should run these two steps: 
(Note that if all finding aids are loaded, the reindex step can take quite a while)
     $ ./manage.py existdb_index load
     $ ./manage.py existdb_reindex  

The FINDINGAID_EAD_SOURCE should be set to the directory path for the
EAD files that will be accessible for loading to eXist via the admin
interface.


Install `xhtml2pdf/Pisa`_ and its dependencies. On Ubuntu, the following
should be sufficient::

  $ sudo apt-get install python-reportlab python-html5lib
  $ sudo easy_install pisa
