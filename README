Dependencies
------------
 * django 1.2
 * eXist-db 1.4 
 * xhtml2pdf/Pisa for PDF generation (http://www.xhtml2pdf.com)
 * celery and RabbitMQ
 * zc.icp for querying cache status
 * eulcore (currently included as a subversion external); see
   :ref:`eulcore dependencies <eulcore-deps>` for per-module
   dependencies. eulcore modules currently in use:

   * eulcore.xmlmap
   * eulcore.existdb and eulcore.django.existdb
   * eulcore.django.ldap
   * eulcore.django.testsetup
   * eulcore.django.http

Installation
------------

Install and configure like other django applications. 

Copy ``localsettings-sample.py`` to ``localsettings.py`` and customize the settings.

The configured eXist-db user should be in the DBA group if you plan to
use the app to manage the eXist index configuration. For more
information on existdb index commands::

     $ ./manage.py help existdb_index
     $ ./manage.py help existdb_reindex

For a first-time install, you will should run these two steps: 
(Note that if all finding aids are loaded, the reindex step can take quite a while)::

     $ ./manage.py existdb_index load
     $ ./manage.py existdb_reindex  

The EXISTDB_PREVIEW_COLLECTION should be set to an eXist collection outside of the
main Finding Aids collection in eXist; it is used for admin functionality only.

The FINDINGAID_EAD_SOURCE should be set to the directory path for the
EAD files that will be accessible for loading to eXist via the admin
interface.


Install `xhtml2pdf/Pisa`_ and its dependencies. On Ubuntu, the following
should be sufficient::

  $ sudo apt-get install python-reportlab python-html5lib
  $ sudo easy_install pisa

.. _xhtml2pdf/Pisa: http://www.xhtml2pdf.com/doc/pisa-en.html


Install `celery` and `rabbitmq` for asynchronous task handling.  On
Ubuntu, this can be done as follows::

  $ sudo easy_install celery
  $ sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server

There is a celery daemon that should be running in order to process any 
celery tasks that are scheduled. It can be started via manage.py::

  $ python manage.py celeryd

Install `zc.icp` in order to use the check_pdfcache manage command
to check the status of PDFs in the configured cache.

  $ sudo easy_install zc.icp


.. _eulcore-deps:

eulcore dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. include:: external/django-modules/eulcore/README.dependencies 



To install all the necessary components for a development environment
on an Ubuntu 10.04 workstation:

sudo apt-get install python-ldap python-pisa python-lxml python-ply rabbitmq-server
sudo easy_install celery mimeparse

This assumes you already have a django 1.2 installation and python bindings
for the database platform you are using (e.g., python-mysqldb for mysql).

If you are running a version of Ubuntu earlier than 10.04, the
python-pisa package will not be available and you will have to install
pisa as documented above.
