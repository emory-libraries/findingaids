</h2> <h3>The Belfast Group</h3> <p>The Belfast Group, begun by Philip Hobsbaum
in 1963 and continued by Seamus Heaney until 1972, provided a unique
environment for the presentation and discussion of new work by younger Northern
Irish writers, many of whom are heavily represented in the Woodruff Library's
General and Special Collections. At meetings, worksheets of the poems presented
at a given session were prepared and passed out to a diverse group of
colleagues, friends, and rivals.

website presents a complete catalog of all known Group worksheets as well as
added information about the Group and its constituent authors.</p> <h2>
