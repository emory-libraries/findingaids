The following is a summary of changes and improvements to the Finding
Aids application.  New features in each version should be listed, with the most
recent version first.  Upgrade or deployment notes should be found in
:ref:`DEPLOYNOTES`.

1.9.1
-----

* Prep step returns an incorrect message for new finding aids.

  materials are stored offsite so that I know retrieval of these
  materials will take longer.
* As a user, I can see a scope note at the folder level of the finding
  aid in order to see additional information the archivist has added
  about that folder's contents.
* As an administrator, I can change staff contacts listed in the finding
  aids database website so that I can manage the names and emails displayed
  on the request materials page.

  aid so that I can analyze and organize the works in a personâ€™s papers
  according to genre.
* As a researcher, I want to export titles' ISBN, ISSN, or OCLC numbers
  from a finding aid so that I can access the data associated with those

* bugfix: RDFa collection resource should be URI instead of string

1.7 - administrative and internal digital archival object support
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* When a logged in administrative user is searching the finding aids
  database, they can optionally restrict results to all collections with
  digital objects.
* Researchers will be able to see identifiers for digitized content that
  can only be accessed in the reading room, so that they can search for
  those items in the kiosk.
* When an administrative user is viewing the web page for a single
  finding aid, they can search for digital objects within that finding
  aid either by entering a keyword/keyword phrase in combination with the
  digital objects only filter or by just searching for all the digital
  objects in the finding aid.
* When an administrative user is logged into the finding aids database,
  they will see an indication that they are logged in on each page of the
  finding aids website in order to remember which view (administrative or
  public) they are seeing.
* When administrative users view webpages for a finding aid with digital
  archival object references in the EAD document, they can distinguish
  when the <dao> display in the administrative view is different from the
  public view and when <dao> information is hidden from the public view
  completely.
* A logged in findingaids staff user will be able to see links for
  internal-only digitized content, including any that are suppressed
  from display for researchers, so that they can access and manage
  archival digitized content.
* When administrative users view webpages for a finding aid with digital
  archival object references in the EAD document, they can see and click
  on links in order to access all the digital archival objects created
  or owned by Emory University, both public and for internal use only.
* A developer or system administrator can run a script on all EAD finding
  aids to add digital archival object references for container-level items
  that include digital filenames in order to provide administrative access
  to digitized content and prepare for future access options.
* As a researcher, I want to be able to see archivist supplied notes about
  processing at the series and subseries level so that I can understand
  how to locate material within a collection.
* New banners from the home page.

* bugfix: series titles with quotes break RDFa output
* bugfix: As a researcher, I want to be able to see any notes associated
  with index content, so that I have any additional information provided
  by the archivists.
* bugfix: As a researcher, I want to be able to see archivist supplied
  notes about processing at the series and subseries level so that I can
  understand how to locate material within a collection.
* bugfix: correct RDFa relation between collection and creator of the collection.

1.6
---

* Remove dependency on RSS feeds for content pages, home page banners,
  and home page news items.
* Updated organizational logo in the header.
* bugfix: Loading the list of finding aid files from subversion in the
  tabbed display of the administrative interface is too slow.
* bugfix: display repeated <separatedmaterial> sections (formerly
  only the first one was being displayed)
* bugfix: if a login session times out, admin file tabs will not load;
  now redirects user to login again

1.5.1
-----

* bugfix: configure celery task added in 1.5 for svn checkout so it is
  directed to findingaids queue so it gets picked up by the celery worker.

1.5
---

* A superuser can associate an archivist with one or more archives and their
  corresponding subversion repositories so that archivists can preview and
  publish for only the archives they are assigned.
* Superusers of the finding aids database can easily navigate between the
  django administrative module and the finding aids database administrative module.
* When an archivist associated with a single archive logs in to the admin site,
  they see a list of EAD documents in the associated subversion repository and
  are able to prep, preview, and publish finding aids from that repository.
* When an archivist associated with multiple archives logs in to the admin site,
  they see a tab for each corresponding subversion repository, each with a list
  of EAD documents in that subversion repo for prep, preview and publication.
* An archivist with permissions on multiple archives can choose a primary
  archive so they can view EAD documents from that repository by default
  when they log in.
* When an archivist preps an EAD document that requires modifications, they can
  click a button to accept and apply those changes so that updates are automatically
  committed to subversion on their behalf.
* Archivists can only prep, preview, and publish EAD documents from the  subversion
  repositories they have been associated with in the admin site, for security.
* An archivist can only delete a published finding aid from the website if it is
  associated with an archive that they have permission to manage, for security reasons.
* When an archivist with permissions for multiple repositories selects a repository
  tab on the main admin page, that repository tab stays active until they select
  another repository or logout, in order to avoid confusion when prepping,
  previewing, and publishing content from a single repository.
* Deprecated and unused support for publish without preview has been removed.
* New celery task: when an archive is defined or updated, check out (or update)
  a local copy of the subversion repository.
* bugfix: add redirect for top-level /favicon.ico url

1.4.1
-----

* bugfix to correct PDF generation (broken in some cases due to template
  changes relating to RDFa output)

1.4 - RDFa
----------

* When a search engine accesses the web page for a finding aid, it can
  harvest semantic information about the finding aid document, so that
  the document can be related to other embedded semantic content.
* A system or technical user can view RDF XML based on the embedded RDFa
  in a finding aid page, in order to harvest RDF in a more standard format
  or to review the embedded data on the page.
* When a search engine accesses the web page for a finding aid with names
  tagged in the EAD, it can harvest semantic information about the originator
  of the finding aid from the collection description so the embedded data
  can become useful in another context.
* When a search engine accesses the Index of Selected Correspondents for
  a finding aid with names tagged in the EAD, it can harvest semantic
  information about correspondents with the originator of the finding aid
  so the embedded data can become useful in another context.
* When a search engine accesses a finding aid series describing correspondence
  for a finding aid with names tagged in the EAD, it can harvest semantic
  information about correspondents with the originator of the finding aid
  so the embedded data can become useful in another context
* When a search engine accesses the finding aid series for the Belfast Group
  Worksheets for a finding aid with names tagged in the EAD, it can harvest
  semantic information about participants in the group so the embedded data
  can become useful in another context.
* When a search engine accesses the finding aid series for the Belfast Group
  Worksheets for a finding aid with names tagged in the EAD, it can harvest
  group sheet titles in order so that title sequence can be preserved.

1.3
---

* When a researcher is viewing web pages or PDF documents for a finding aid
  with digital archival object references in the EAD document, they can see and
  click on links in order to access digital items associated with the
  collection.
* A researcher searching within a single finding aid can optionally restrict
  results to items that include digital objects in order to find digital content
  by keyword or all digital objects in one finding aid.
* A researcher searching all finding aids by keyword can optionally restrict
  results to collections with publicly accessible digital objects in order to make
  use of archival items available online.
* A researcher viewing the web page or PDF for a finding aid with
  digital archival object references in the EAD can see that the
  finding aid includes digital content by a header at the top of the
  page, so that they are aware some of the materials may be available
  online.
* Users can view PDF documents from within a browser so they can view,
  print, and save the entire finding aid quickly and easily.
* Configurable beta warning to be displayed in test/staging sites; turn on
  via **ENABLE_BETA_WARNING** setting.

1.2
---

* Updated to Django 1.5.
* When a user is viewing web pages for a finding aid with external references (extref tags)
  in the EAD document, they can see and click on links in order to access
  external webpages.
* When a user downloads the PDF for a finding aid with external references
  in the EAD document, they can click on links in case they want to access
  related content from the PDF.
* Automated tools, such as search engine robots or site crawlers, can find
  machine-readable site maps for findingaids and content pages, in order to
  improve search engine harvesting of finding aids site content.
* Bug fix: related material section should be displayed when present at series level

1.1
---

* When an admin is logged in, they will see a link to the admin page at
  the top of the left sidebar, so that they can always get back to the
  main admin page.
* A researcher viewing the HTML or PDF version of a finding aid can see
  the processing information from the EAD, so that they know who is responsible
  for the content.
* Updated to Django 1.4.2
* Updates to follow team best practices for Django project code organization:

  * Moved media directory to top-level sitemedia directory
  * Moved templates directory to top-level and moved app-specific templates
    into their respective apps.
  * Renamed localsettings.py example from ``localsettings-sample.py`` to
    ``localsettings.py.dist``

  site, an ARK will be generated and added to the 'prepared' EAD.
* When an archivist runs the 'prep' step on a Finding Aid with no ARK
  stored in the EADID, but for which an ARK has already been generated,
  the existing ARK will be used and the archivist will see an

  to find relevant folder contents in a large finding aid.
* Researchers can click on a subject heading (any of the controlaccess terms)
  in a single finding aid to discover other finding aids with the same subject headings.
* When browsing finding aids by any first letter, a researcher can jump to
  alphabetical groupings within that letter, to enable identifying and accessing
  a particular portion of that browse listing (e.g., A-Ar, As-Ax, etc.).
