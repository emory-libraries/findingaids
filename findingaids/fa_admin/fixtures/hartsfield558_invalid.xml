		<head>Biographical Note</head> 
		<p>William Berry Hartsfield (March 1, 1890-February 22, 1971), attorney, politician, and mayor of Atlanta was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Charles Green Hartsfield, a tinsmith, and Victoria Dagnall Hartsfield.  He married Pearl Williams on August 2, 1913 and they had two children, William Berry Hartsfield, Jr. and Mildred Hartsfield Cheshire.  They divorced after forty-eight years of marriage and Hartsfield married Tollie Tolan on July 11, 1962.  He later adopted her son, Carl.</p> 
		<p>Hartsfield attended Boys High School in Atlanta and found employment as a clerk for the General Fire Extinguisher Company.  In 1916, while working as a clerk for the legal firm of Rosser, Slaton, Phillips, and Hopkins, he began reading law.  His formal education was completed in 1937, when the Atlanta Law School awarded him a Bachelor of Law degree. Hartsfield was admitted to the Georgia Bar in 1917 and established a practice in Atlanta.  His first entrance into the political arena came in 1923, with his election to the City Council of Atlanta.  He remained a council member until 1928.  During this time, he served on the municipal airport committee and helped arrange the purchase of Candler Field as the site for the city's first municipal airport.  The Hartsfield International Airport is named in his honor.</p><p>From 1933 to 1937, Hartsfield served as a Fulton County Representative to the Georgia Legislature.  In 1936, he defeated incumbent Mayor James L. Key in the first of the seven mayoral elections he entered.  With the exception of an eighteen-month period in 1941-1942, Hartsfield served as the city's chief administrator continuously from 1937 to 1962.  As mayor, Hartsfield saw the city more than triple in land area, grow to have over a million inhabitants, and survive the Depression and World War II fiscally sound and ready to undertake such civic improvements as building expressways and city parks.  An early racial moderate, he guided the city through the 1950s and the beginnings of the Civil Rights Movement.  Hartsfield also served as an officer in two mining companies, the Southern Talc Company of Atlanta and Chatsworth, Georgia (1933-1942) and the Georgia Lightweight Aggregate Company (1951-1954).  Throughout most of his life, he maintained an interest in Georgia's mineral development.</p><p>Following Hartsfield's retirement from city government in 1962, he was named Mayor Emeritus and became a consultant to the Ford Foundation's Committee of Review and Evaluation, Urban Program; to the Rockefeller Foundation's Performing Arts Panel; and to the Coca Cola Company.  He was also named president of the Southeastern Fair Association.  A life-long member of the First Baptist Church of Atlanta, Hartsfield was also a Democrat, a Mason, and a Shriner.  Among the many honors he received were honorary Doctorate of Law degrees from Oglethorpe University and Atlanta University, both in 1961.</p>

			 <p>This series contains the personal business records of Hartsfield.  In addition to his work as Mayor of Atlanta, Hartsfield maintained an active interest in the development of Georgia's mineral and mining activities.  He helped to found the Southern Talc Company in 1933, serving as its president throughout the 1930s and 1940s.  This series contains the business records of the Southern Talc Company and documents Hartsfield's work in that company.  The series also contains Hartsfield's subject files on minerals and mining in Georgia.</p>

			 <p>This subseries contains subject files related to Hartsfield's interest in minerals and mining, his primary non-Atlanta and non-mayoral pastime.  From the early 1930s through the late 1950s, Hartsfield maintained an active interest in the development of Georgia's mineral industries, occasionally investing in mining ventures.  He investigated the possibility of drilling for oil in the north Georgia mountains and bought shares in talc, mica, and phosphate mines.  He was also a founder and director of the Georgia Lightweight Aggregate Company, 1951-1954.  Hartsfield never achieved the financial success he desired and, by the time of his retirement from politics, he had turned his attentions elsewhere.  This subseries consists mostly of correspondence, although there are occasional financial records, newspaper clippings, and published reports among the correspondence in the files.</p>

			 <p>This series contains the records of the Southern Talc Company of Atlanta and Chatsworth, Georgia.  The company was incorporated in 1933 and sold in 1942. Hartsfield helped organize the company and served as legal counsel and president.  This was apparently Hartsfield's first major business venture and the only time he played such an active role in guiding the affairs of a company.  Included among the company's papers are letters advertising the talc for sale; correspondence with sales agents and purchasers; inventories; purchasing orders; receipts; and correspondence between Hartsfield, T.N. Brooks, and V.C. Pickering, fellow officers of the Company.  The Southern Talc Company was a small mining company which battled both the sluggish economy of the Depression and the mineral use restrictions of the first years of World War II and was only a limited financial success.  This subseries consists mostly of correspondence, with scattered blueprints, reports, and financial records.</p>

			 <p>This series contains collected printed material about Hartsfield and materials collected by him.  Hartsfield saved many magazine and newspaper articles, pamphlets, and reports relating to himself and to the government and welfare of Atlanta.  These include magazine, periodical, and newspaper clippings; pamphlets, flyers, and reports of various Atlanta organizations; and event programs. Magazine and newspaper clippings featuring Hartsfield are listed separately from general clippings. Programs commemorate public events attended by Hartsfield, including dedications, awards ceremonies, and dinners. Among the many topics, issues, and events dating from the 1920s to the early 1980s documented in this series are Atlanta roadways and traffic, elections of Atlanta government officials, local crime, aviation, and debate on local legislature.

			 <p>This series contains photographs of William B. Hartsfield, his family, other politicians and national figures, and Atlanta events from the 1860s to the 1970s.  The bulk of this series highlights the ceremonial duties of the mayor of a growing American city (1930s-1971).  Welcoming Hollywood stars and city visitors, cutting ribbons for grand openings, and attending dinners and banquets are well-photographed mayoral duties.  Other events are <title>Gone with the Wind</title> premieres; travels to Europe and South America; meetings with Presidents, politicians, the Pope, and others; various stages in the development of the Chattahoochee River and Buford Dam water systems; the expansion of the airport; and several inaugural air flights on which Hartsfield was a passenger.  Portrait photographs of Hartsfield from childhood to shortly before his death are also included in this series (1892-1971).  There is also a large collection of family and other personal photographs (circa 1860s-1960s).  Tollie Tolan Hartsfield's personal photographs (circa 1890s-1970s), also located in this series, contain few pictures related to Mayor Hartsfield.  They primarily show scenes of friends, family, and vacations from before her marriage to Hartsfield and after his death.  Eight photograph albums of ceremonial events, such as the launching of the U.S.S. Atlanta and the dedication of St. Joseph's Hospital, are also included in this series.</p>

			 <p>The memorabilia series contains various objects collected by Hartsfield during his political career and after his retirement.  Included are multiple keys to cities, including two oversized wooden keys given to Hartsfield by Atlanta residents, two gavels, and cards from various businesses and civic associations.  There is also a substantial amount of campaign ephemera, including buttons, combs, match books, nail files, and thimbles, from local, state and federal political campaigns.  Ribbons, medals and name tags show Hartsfield's many associations and involvement in regional conferences.  Tickets, name tags and visitor passes shed light on Hartsfield's travels to Democratic National Conventions, Congress, the White House, and events he attended, such as the launching of Apollo 12.  There is also a pen in the collection from the White House which was possibly used by President Lyndon B. Johnson to sign the 1964 Civil Rights Bill into law.</p>

			 <p>This series contains subject files and correspondence belonging to Moses Cox from 1946-1954.  The series contains very little material directly to or from Hartsfield.  Cox was associated with the Georgia State Highway Department and the American Society of Civil Engineers and involved in Atlanta roadway planning and construction during the Hartsfield administration from the 1920s through the 1960s.  Correspondence, memorandums, cost estimates, reports, and plans document parking, traffic, roadway planning and construction.  Federal funding for roadway construction, safety reports, and bond commission activity, the Atlanta Expressway, land purchases for roadway development, and water services for new roadways are all topics covered in this series.  The secretarial files are Cox's correspondence, organized by last name, from his time as secretary of the Joint Bond Commission.</p>
