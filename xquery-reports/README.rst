XQuery Reports
==============

This directory contains XQueries which can be used to generate reports across all
EAD documents loaded in the eXist collection.

To run the XQuery reports from OxygenXML, you should configure an eXist connection
as described here: http://oxygenxml.com/eXist_support.html
