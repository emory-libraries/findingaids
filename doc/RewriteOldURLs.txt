The following text should be used as apache rewrite rules to redirect
urls from the current drupal-embedded finding aids urls as well as the
previous stand-alone php finding aids.

Notes:
 - These patterns should work for both drupal-embedded versions of the
   urls and the standalone-php urls (no longer acceptable, but still
   getting hits in the apache log from search engines)
   - the trailing ? on new urls is used to clear out the query string 
     in the new urls
 - a RewriteBase may need to be specified
 - rewrite patterns may need to be updated if current document/series
   format changes
 - currently redirecting any series other than top-level to main
   page for that finding aid; if the full url can be inferred from the
   data available in the initial url, we should do that; if not, this
   is an acceptable substitute,  but perhaps the series redirect
   should not uss a permanent redirect code.
 - assuming redirects are not needed for other portions of the site
   (browse, search, etc.)
