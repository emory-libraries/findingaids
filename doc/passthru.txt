Tips for setting up & using the tamino passthru server


Define a simple schema for the collection with a doctype called
xsl:stylesheet.  Define only the root node "xsl:stylesheet" with
content type of ANY, no indexing.

When uploading the xsl files to tamino, use the Tamino Interactive
Interface to specify the filename.  For example, in the database URL
field, put something like this:
http://vip.library.emory.edu/tamino/BECKCTR/ILN/xsl:stylesheet/ilncontents.xsl
And in the "Process" field, put the full path to the local copy of
this file.  

Note that you must leave the "Collection" field blank in this case, or
it will add something to the name of the file you are uploading which
will make it impossible for you to successfully reference your
stylesheet by name.

To use this stylsheet you have just uploaded, change the tamino url so
it will use the passthru servlet (i.e., add
"passthru/servlet/transform" between the machine name and "tamino")
and specify the uploaded stylesheet with the _xslsrc argument.  It
should look something like this:

http://tamino.library.emory.edu/passthru/servlet/transform/tamino/BECKCTR/ILN?_xql=TEI.2//div1&_xslsrc=xsl:stylesheet/ilncontents.xsl
