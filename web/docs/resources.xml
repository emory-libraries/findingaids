 <h3>The Belfast Group</h3>

 <p>The Belfast Group, begun by Philip Hobsbaum in 1963 and continued
 by Seamus Heaney until 1972, provided a unique environment for the
 presentation and discussion of new work by younger Northern Irish
 writers, many of whom are heavily represented in the Woodruff
 Library's General and Special Collections. At meetings, worksheets of
 the poems presented at a given session were prepared and passed out
 to a diverse group of colleagues, friends, and rivals.  <a
 href="http://chaucer.library.emory.edu/irishpoet/"> The Belfast Group
 </a> website presents a complete catalog of all known Group
 worksheets as well as added information about the Group and its
 constituent authors.</p>
